# Oracle Database Administration II (1Z0-083) - Thresholds, Metrics, and Server-Generated Alerts

## Question:
Which three are true about **thresholds, metrics, and server-generated alerts**? *(Choose three.)*

**A.** All metrics are instance-related.  
**B.** Cleared stateful alerts are displayed by querying `DBA_ALERT_HISTORY`.  
**C.** A space usage management alert is automatically cleared after the underlying problem is resolved.  
**D.** They are generated by `SMON` when a tablespace is 97% full.  
**E.** Metrics are statistical counts for a specific unit.  
**F.** `STATISTICS_LEVEL` must be set to `ALL` to generate alerts.  

---

## **Correct Answers:**  
✔ **B. Cleared stateful alerts are displayed by querying `DBA_ALERT_HISTORY`.**  
✔ **C. A space usage management alert is automatically cleared after the underlying problem is resolved.**  
✔ **E. Metrics are statistical counts for a specific unit.**  

---

## **Explanation:**

1. **Cleared stateful alerts are displayed by querying `DBA_ALERT_HISTORY` (Option B - ✅ True)**
   - Stateful alerts (e.g., space usage alerts) remain in the `DBA_OUTSTANDING_ALERTS` view **until the issue is resolved**.
   - Once cleared, they **move to** `DBA_ALERT_HISTORY`, where they are recorded for reference.
   - **Oracle Documentation Evidence:**  
     - The *Oracle Database Administrator's Guide* confirms that **historical alerts** can be viewed in the `DBA_ALERT_HISTORY` dictionary view.

2. **A space usage management alert is automatically cleared after the underlying problem is resolved (Option C - ✅ True)**
   - Space-related alerts (e.g., tablespace usage exceeding thresholds) are **stateful**.  
   - If the condition that triggered the alert **is no longer met**, Oracle **automatically clears** the alert.
   - **Example:** If a tablespace previously exceeded 97% full but new space is added, the alert is cleared.
   - **Oracle Documentation Evidence:**  
     - The *Oracle Database Administrator’s Guide* states that **stateful alerts are automatically cleared** when the issue is resolved.

3. **Metrics are statistical counts for a specific unit (Option E - ✅ True)**
   - Metrics are **quantitative measurements** collected over time, such as CPU usage, active sessions, redo log switches, etc.
   - These are recorded in **V$SYSMETRIC** and **V$SYSMETRIC_HISTORY**.
   - **Oracle Documentation Evidence:**  
     - The *Oracle Database Performance Tuning Guide* defines **metrics** as **statistical counts** collected over a fixed interval.

---

## **Why the Other Options Are Incorrect:**

1. **All metrics are instance-related (Option A - ❌ False)**
   - Some metrics are **session-specific**, **tablespace-specific**, or **system-wide**, not just instance-related.
   - Example: **Tablespace free space** is a metric, but it is **not an instance metric**.
   - **Oracle Documentation Evidence:**  
     - The *Oracle Database Performance Tuning Guide* categorizes **various types of metrics**, including **tablespace and I/O metrics**, which are not always instance-specific.

2. **They are generated by `SMON` when a tablespace is 97% full (Option D - ❌ False)**
   - Alerts are **generated by MMON (Memory Monitor Process)**, **not SMON**.
   - **Oracle Documentation Evidence:**  
     - The *Oracle Database Concepts Guide* states that **MMON is responsible for generating metrics and alerts**, not `SMON`.

3. **`STATISTICS_LEVEL` must be set to `ALL` to generate alerts (Option F - ❌ False)**
   - Alerts require `STATISTICS_LEVEL = TYPICAL` **or** `ALL`.
   - `TYPICAL` is the **default** setting and is sufficient for generating server alerts.
   - **Oracle Documentation Evidence:**  
     - The *Oracle Database Reference Guide* confirms that **alerts are collected when `STATISTICS_LEVEL` is at least `TYPICAL`**, not necessarily `ALL`.

---

## **Conclusion:**
- **Correct answers:** **B, C, and E.**
- Oracle automatically **clears space usage alerts** once resolved.
- Metrics represent **statistical counts** over time.
- **Stateful alerts move to `DBA_ALERT_HISTORY`** once cleared.
- MMON (not SMON) generates alerts, and `STATISTICS_LEVEL = TYPICAL` is sufficient.
