# Oracle Database Administration II (1Z0-083) - RMAN Backup Performance Optimization

## Question:
While backing up to an SBT channel, you determine that the read phase of your compressed Recovery Manager (RMAN) incremental level 0 backup is a bottleneck.  
**FORCE LOGGING** is enabled for the database.  

Which two could improve read performance? *(Choose two.)*

**A.** Increase the size of tape I/O buffers.  
**B.** Disable FORCE LOGGING for the database.  
**C.** Increase the size of the database buffer cache.  
**D.** Enable asynchronous disk I/O.  
**E.** Increase the level of RMAN multiplexing.

## Correct Answers:  
✔ **C. Increase the size of the database buffer cache.**  
✔ **D. Enable asynchronous disk I/O.**  

---

## Explanation:

The **read phase** of an RMAN backup refers to how efficiently data blocks are read from disk into memory before being processed and written to the backup destination (SBT in this case). The following options directly impact the read performance:

1. **Increasing the database buffer cache (Option C)**
   - RMAN reads datafile blocks into the database buffer cache before writing them to the backup. A **larger buffer cache** can help reduce disk I/O by retaining more blocks in memory, leading to **faster reads**.
   - **Oracle Documentation Evidence:**  
     - The *Oracle Database Backup and Recovery User's Guide* recommends increasing the **database buffer cache** to enhance RMAN performance, especially for **full and incremental backups**.

2. **Enabling asynchronous disk I/O (Option D)**
   - **Asynchronous I/O** allows RMAN to read multiple database blocks **concurrently** instead of waiting for each read to complete before starting the next one. This significantly **reduces I/O wait time** and improves overall read performance.
   - **Oracle Documentation Evidence:**  
     - The *Oracle Database Performance Tuning Guide* states that **asynchronous I/O** improves backup performance by **allowing concurrent disk reads**, reducing contention and bottlenecks.

## Why the Other Options Are Incorrect:

1. **Increasing the size of tape I/O buffers (Option A) - ❌ Incorrect**
   - Tape I/O buffers affect **write performance to tape**, not the **read phase** from the database. Since the bottleneck is in reading from disk, this does not help.

2. **Disabling FORCE LOGGING (Option B) - ❌ Incorrect**
   - **FORCE LOGGING** only ensures that redo logs are written for certain operations (like direct-path inserts). It does **not** impact RMAN backup read performance.

3. **Increasing RMAN multiplexing (Option E) - ❌ Not the best option**
   - **Multiplexing** allows RMAN to read from multiple datafiles simultaneously, but excessive multiplexing can cause **disk contention**, increasing latency rather than improving performance.

---

## Conclusion:
To improve **read performance** of an RMAN incremental level 0 backup to an SBT channel, **increase the database buffer cache** and **enable asynchronous I/O**. These optimizations reduce disk I/O bottlenecks and enhance backup speed.
