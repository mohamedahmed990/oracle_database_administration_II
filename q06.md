# Oracle Database Administration II (1Z0-083) - Common Objects

## **Question:**
Which two are true about **common objects**? *(Choose two.)*

**A.** They can be created only in `CDB$ROOT`.  
**B.** They can be only **metadata-linked** in an application container.  
**C.** They can exist in **user-defined schemas** only in **application containers**.  
**D.** They can exist in `CDB$ROOT` and an **application root**.  
**E.** They can be **extended data-linked** in `CDB$ROOT`.  
**F.** They can be created only in an **application root**.  

---

## **Correct Answers:**  
✔ **B. They can be only metadata-linked in an application container.**  
✔ **D. They can exist in `CDB$ROOT` and an application root.**  

---

## **Explanation:**

### **What Are Common Objects?**
In a **Multitenant Container Database (CDB)**, **common objects** are objects that exist **in multiple containers** (like `CDB$ROOT` and application roots). These objects are **shared across pluggable databases (PDBs)**, ensuring consistency and easier management.

---

### **Answer Breakdown:**

1. **B. They can be only metadata-linked in an application container. (✅ True)**
   - In an **application container**, common objects can be **metadata-linked**.
   - **Metadata-linked objects** share their metadata across PDBs in an application container but store data independently.
   - **Oracle Documentation Evidence:**  
     - The *Oracle Database Multitenant Guide* states that **common objects in an application container use metadata links**.

2. **D. They can exist in `CDB$ROOT` and an application root. (✅ True)**
   - Common objects can exist **both in `CDB$ROOT` (the root container) and an application root**.
   - They help enforce **uniform application metadata** across pluggable databases.
   - **Oracle Documentation Evidence:**  
     - The *Oracle Database Multitenant Guide* confirms that **common objects exist in both `CDB$ROOT` and application roots**.

---

### **Why the Other Options Are Incorrect:**

1. **A. They can be created only in `CDB$ROOT`. (❌ False)**
   - **Common objects are not limited to `CDB$ROOT`.**  
   - They can also be created in **application roots**.
   - **Oracle Documentation Evidence:**  
     - The *Oracle Multitenant Guide* explains that common objects exist **in `CDB$ROOT` and application roots**, not just `CDB$ROOT`.

2. **C. They can exist in user-defined schemas only in application containers. (❌ False)**
   - Common objects are not **restricted to user-defined schemas**.
   - They can exist in the **root containers (`CDB$ROOT` and application root)**.
   - **Oracle Documentation Evidence:**  
     - The *Oracle Database Multitenant Guide* states that **common objects exist in root containers and application containers**, not just in user-defined schemas.

3. **E. They can be extended data-linked in `CDB$ROOT`. (❌ False)**
   - **Extended data-linked objects** are only available in **application containers**, not in `CDB$ROOT`.
   - **Oracle Documentation Evidence:**  
     - The *Oracle Database Multitenant Guide* explains that **extended data links apply only to application containers**.

4. **F. They can be created only in an application root. (❌ False)**
   - **Common objects are not restricted to application roots**.
   - They can be created **in `CDB$ROOT` as well**.
   - **Oracle Documentation Evidence:**  
     - The *Oracle Multitenant Guide* confirms that **common objects exist in both `CDB$ROOT` and application roots**.

---

## **Conclusion:**
- **Common objects** can be **metadata-linked in application containers** (**B - ✅ True**).
- They **exist in both `CDB$ROOT` and an application root** (**D - ✅ True**).
- The correct answers are: **B and D**.
