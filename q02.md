### **Question:**  
Which three are true about requirements for various **FLASHBACK** operations? **(Choose three.)**  

**A.** FLASHBACK transaction query requires **undo** to retrieve all versions of a row that existed between two points in time.  
**B.** FLASHBACK drop requires that the **RECYCLEBIN** parameter be set to **ON**.  
**C.** FLASHBACK version query requires that the **RECYCLEBIN** parameter be set to **ON**.  
**D.** FLASHBACK DATA ARCHIVE requires **undo** to store all versions of all rows of a table being tracked.  
**E.** FLASHBACK drop requires **undo** to retrieve all versions of a row that existed between two points in time.  
**F.** FLASHBACK version query requires **undo** to retrieve all versions of a row that existed between two points in time.

### **Answer:**  
‚úÖ **A. FLASHBACK transaction query requires undo to retrieve all versions of a row that existed between two points in time.**  
‚úÖ **B. FLASHBACK drop requires that the RECYCLEBIN parameter be set to ON.**  
‚úÖ **F. FLASHBACK version query requires undo to retrieve all versions of a row that existed between two points in time.**

### **Explanation:**  

#### ‚úÖ **A. FLASHBACK transaction query requires undo to retrieve all versions of a row that existed between two points in time.**  
- **FLASHBACK TRANSACTION QUERY** allows viewing **previous versions** of rows within the **UNDO tablespace**.  
- This relies on **undo data** to reconstruct past states of a row between two timestamps.  

üìå **Example:**  
```sql
SELECT versions_starttime, versions_endtime, versions_xid, salary 
FROM employees VERSIONS BETWEEN TIMESTAMP 
   TO_TIMESTAMP('2024-02-25 10:00:00', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS')  
   AND SYSTIMESTAMP 
WHERE employee_id = 100;
```
- This retrieves all past versions of a row for `employee_id = 100`.

#### ‚úÖ **B. FLASHBACK drop requires that the RECYCLEBIN parameter be set to ON.**  
- When a table is **dropped**, Oracle **does not immediately remove it** from storage.  
- Instead, if `RECYCLEBIN=ON`, it moves the table to the **Recycle Bin**, allowing it to be restored.  
- **If `RECYCLEBIN=OFF`, dropped objects are permanently removed.**  

üìå **Example:**  
```sql
SHOW PARAMETER RECYCLEBIN;
```
```sql
FLASHBACK TABLE employees TO BEFORE DROP;
```

üìö **Reference:** [Flashback Drop and Recycle Bin](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/adfns/using-flashback-features.html#GUID-2FEC8193-2B5D-497A-9278-AB2E69380A96)  

---

#### ‚úÖ **F. FLASHBACK version query requires undo to retrieve all versions of a row that existed between two points in time.**  
- **FLASHBACK VERSION QUERY** retrieves **multiple past versions** of a row based on `UNDO` data.  
- This feature relies on **undo** to reconstruct past changes to a row.  

üìå **Example:**  
```sql
SELECT versions_startscn, versions_endscn, versions_xid, salary 
FROM employees VERSIONS BETWEEN SCN 1000 AND 2000  
WHERE employee_id = 100;
```
- This retrieves the historical changes of `salary` for `employee_id = 100` between SCN 1000 and 2000.

### **Why Are the Other Options Incorrect?**  

| Option | Explanation |
|--------|------------|
| **C. FLASHBACK version query requires that the RECYCLEBIN parameter be set to ON.** | ‚ùå **Wrong** ‚Üí `RECYCLEBIN` is only needed for **FLASHBACK DROP**, not **FLASHBACK VERSION QUERY**. |
| **D. FLASHBACK DATA ARCHIVE requires undo to store all versions of all rows of a table being tracked.** | ‚ùå **Wrong** ‚Üí **Flashback Data Archive (FDA)** stores historical data **outside of UNDO tablespace**. It keeps historical records for long-term storage **beyond the UNDO retention period**. |
| **E. FLASHBACK drop requires undo to retrieve all versions of a row that existed between two points in time.** | ‚ùå **Wrong** ‚Üí `FLASHBACK DROP` restores an entire **table** from the **Recycle Bin**, but it does **not retrieve row versions**. |

---

### **Final Answer:**  
‚úÖ **A. FLASHBACK transaction query requires undo to retrieve all versions of a row that existed between two points in time.**  
‚úÖ **B. FLASHBACK drop requires that the RECYCLEBIN parameter be set to ON.**  
‚úÖ **F. FLASHBACK version query requires undo to retrieve all versions of a row that existed between two points in time.**
