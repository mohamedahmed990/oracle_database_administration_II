# Oracle Database Administration II (1Z0-083) - Automatic Database Diagnostic Monitor (ADDM)

## **Question:**
Which two are true about the **Automatic Database Diagnostic Monitor (ADDM)**? *(Choose two.)*

**A.** It analyzes a period of time corresponding to the 12 hours of activity.  
**B.** It runs automatically after each AWR snapshot.  
**C.** A DBA can run it manually.  
**D.** Results are written to the alert log.  
**E.** It analyzes a period of time corresponding to the last day of activity.  

---

## **Correct Answers:**  
✔ **B. It runs automatically after each AWR snapshot.**  
✔ **C. A DBA can run it manually.**  

---

## **Explanation:**

### **What Is ADDM?**
The **Automatic Database Diagnostic Monitor (ADDM)** is an Oracle tool that **automatically analyzes database performance** and provides tuning recommendations. It is part of the **Automatic Workload Repository (AWR)** and uses AWR snapshots to analyze performance bottlenecks.

---

### **Answer Breakdown:**

1. **B. It runs automatically after each AWR snapshot. (✅ True)**
   - ADDM runs **automatically after every AWR snapshot**, which is typically taken **every hour**.
   - It analyzes database performance for the time **between the last two AWR snapshots**.
   - **Oracle Documentation Evidence:**  
     - The *Oracle Database Performance Tuning Guide* states that **ADDM runs automatically after each AWR snapshot**.

2. **C. A DBA can run it manually. (✅ True)**
   - A **DBA can manually run ADDM** using the `DBMS_ADDM` package.
   - This allows DBAs to **trigger performance analysis at any time**.
   - **Oracle Documentation Evidence:**  
     - The *Oracle Database Performance Tuning Guide* explains that **ADDM can be executed manually using the `DBMS_ADDM` package**.

---

### **Why the Other Options Are Incorrect:**

1. **A. It analyzes a period of time corresponding to the 12 hours of activity. (❌ False)**
   - ADDM **analyzes only the period between two consecutive AWR snapshots** (typically **one hour** by default).
   - It does **not analyze a fixed 12-hour period**.
   - **Oracle Documentation Evidence:**  
     - The *Oracle Database Performance Tuning Guide* states that **ADDM analyzes the interval between two AWR snapshots**, not a fixed 12-hour period.

2. **D. Results are written to the alert log. (❌ False)**
   - ADDM findings **are not written to the alert log**.
   - Instead, results are **stored in the AWR repository** and can be queried using views like `DBA_ADDM_FINDINGS` and `DBA_ADDM_RECOMMENDATIONS`.
   - **Oracle Documentation Evidence:**  
     - The *Oracle Database Performance Tuning Guide* explains that **ADDM results are stored in AWR and not in the alert log**.

3. **E. It analyzes a period of time corresponding to the last day of activity. (❌ False)**
   - ADDM **analyzes only the period between two AWR snapshots**.
   - The analysis period **depends on the AWR snapshot interval**, which is **typically one hour**.
   - **Oracle Documentation Evidence:**  
     - The *Oracle Database Performance Tuning Guide* confirms that **ADDM analyzes the period between AWR snapshots, not an entire day**.

---

## **Conclusion:**
- **ADDM runs automatically after each AWR snapshot** (**B - ✅ True**).
- **DBAs can manually trigger ADDM analysis** (**C - ✅ True**).
- The correct answers are: **B and C**.
