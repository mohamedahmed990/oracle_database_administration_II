### Question:
For which two requirements can you use the `USER_TABLESPACE` clause with the `CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE` command? (Choose two.)

A. To specify a default tablespace in a PDB cloned from another PDB in the same CDB.  
B. To exclude all tablespaces except SYSTEM, SYSAUX, and TEMP when plugging in a PDB.  
C. To include specific user tablespaces only when relocating a PDB.  
D. To specify the list of user tablespaces to include when moving a non-CDB to a PDB.  
E. To exclude a temp tablespace when plugging in a PDB.  
F. To specify the list of tablespaces to include when creating a PDB from the CDB seed.

### Answer:  
The correct answers are:  
- **C. To include specific user tablespaces only when relocating a PDB.**  
- **D. To specify the list of user tablespaces to include when moving a non-CDB to a PDB.**  

---

### Explanation:  

**A. To specify a default tablespace in a PDB cloned from another PDB in the same CDB.**  
- Oracle 19c does not allow the `USER_TABLESPACE` clause to set or manage default tablespaces for a cloned PDB. Default tablespaces must be set separately using `ALTER DATABASE DEFAULT TABLESPACE`.  
- **Conclusion:** Incorrect.  

---

**B. To exclude all tablespaces except SYSTEM, SYSAUX, and TEMP when plugging in a PDB.**  
- `USER_TABLESPACE` cannot be used to exclude all tablespaces except the mandatory ones (SYSTEM, SYSAUX, TEMP).  
- **Conclusion:** Incorrect.  

---

**C. To include specific user tablespaces only when relocating a PDB.**  
- When relocating a PDB, the `USER_TABLESPACE` clause can specify which user tablespaces to include or exclude.  
- **Conclusion:** Correct.  

---

**D. To specify the list of user tablespaces to include when moving a non-CDB to a PDB.**  
- When converting a non-CDB to a PDB, the `USER_TABLESPACE` clause can be used to specify which tablespaces to include.  
- **Conclusion:** Correct.  

---

**E. To exclude a temp tablespace when plugging in a PDB.**  
- TEMP tablespaces are mandatory and cannot be excluded using `USER_TABLESPACE`.  
- **Conclusion:** Incorrect.  

---

**F. To specify the list of tablespaces to include when creating a PDB from the CDB seed.**  
- The structure of a PDB created from the CDB seed is fixed, and `USER_TABLESPACE` cannot be used to include or exclude tablespaces.  
- **Conclusion:** Incorrect.
